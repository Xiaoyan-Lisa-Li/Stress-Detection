# Stress-Detection
  Method 1: 
  
  	Stress detection using facial images that are randomly sampled and cropped from videos.
		
  Method 2: 
  
    Stess detection using RGB signals. RGB signals are extraced from the region of interests (ROIs) that are identified by using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers. 
		
  Method 3: 
  
    Stress detection using the multimodel CNN framework.
