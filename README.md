# Stress-Detection
  Method 1: Stress detection using facial images
  # Data processing
	run `extract_facial_frames.py` to extract frames from videos.
	run `facial_data_process.py` to create csv files and datasets. Rest samples are labeled as "0" and focus samples are labeled as "1".
  Method 2: Stress detection using ECG signals.
  # Data processing
  	run `ecg_data_process.py` to create ECG data.
