# Data processing
run `extract_facial_frames.py` to extract frames from videos.

run `data_processing.py` to create csv files and datasets. Rest samples are labeled as "0" and focus samples are labeled as "1".

# Stress-Detection
  Method 1: Stress detection using facial images that are randomly sampled and cropped from videos.
  
  run `method1.py`
		
  Method 2: Stess detection using RGB signals. RGB signals are extraced from the region of interests (ROIs) that are identified by using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers. 
    	
  Method 3: Stress detection using the multimodel CNN framework.
